    question: "Q. What is a DAO?",
    answer:
      "<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a new kind of entity that operates without central authority or leadershp. Decisions are made from the bottom-up, governed by rules enforced on a blockchain. Members are issued governance tokens, which they use to vote on important decisions, such as how to invest treasury funds or which projects to focus on.</p>",
    answer2:
      "<p>In their purest form, DAOs operate like machines, with the tasks they are instructed to carry out determined by rules embedded into smart contracts. Therefore no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.",
