# üç≠ Welcome to KaramelaDAO

KaramelaDAO is a for-profit decentralized autonomous organization.

Inside Karamela you will find Teams and Projects, with goals that range from education to profitability.

We don‚Äôt have hierarchy, people are organized in Teams in a free and open way, in which everyone is invited to participate and make additions.

## Mission & Values

### Our Mission

\-Democratize via education the beneficial role of DAOs&#x20;

\-Democratize via education access and use of NFTs and Cryptos in an equitable manner

\-Providing meta-knowledge for the future

\-Identification of potential organizations that deal with issues included in the DAO‚Äôs vision and investment opportunities&#x20;

\-Providing access to community-based investment decisions and investment participation (Notes: essentially the DAO will be responsible for performing analysis, proposals, due diligence, voting etc. on investment opportunities. This could start as an "angel fund" and gradually get bigger.&#x20;

\-Based on the citizens' skills we could also boost such opportunities/initiatives by launching an accelerator/edu program. Examples: The LAO & MetaCartel Ventures DAOs)&#x20;

\-Creating unique experiences in the emerging Web3

### Our Values

#### Be Compassionate

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

#### Be Mindful

We do not take advantage of our users' attention and adopt mindful working practices so that we can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our products themselves.

#### Research First

We challenge our own and others' assumptions through qualitative and quantitative research. Not sure about an idea? Test it.
