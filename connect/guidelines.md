# ðŸ‘Œ Behavioral Guidelines

* We love our citizensâ€™ diversity and our multi-cultural profile. Nevertheless, our official language is English. Yet, we remain flexible so if it happens to be part of a conversation and all participants speak other language than English and you feel comfortable, please feel free! Keep in mind , that even if one of the participants doesnâ€™t speak the chosen language, as a matter of courtesy and practical reasons as well , everyone should switch to English! At this point, certain onboarding calls may be bilingual , and you will know it upfront.&#x20;
* When creating your own post on a particular topic, please choose the appropriate channel and describe it as clearly and concisely as possible. In that way, it will be easier for all to interact, exchange and express their point of view.&#x20;
* When responding to posts created by others, make sure to include this thread in your answer, and try to be relevant to the topic.&#x20;
* It would be nice when posting a link , to include a brief description of how the information included , will help to a specific task or be beneficial.
* Share your knowledge generously amongst the citizens of the DAO, in a simple and understandable way. Thatâ€™s how we all become better and better.&#x20;
* We embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion in our DAO. Respect each and every citizen and avoid derogatory, discriminatory or offensive behavior and speech. DAOs administrators reserve the right to remove posts containing racist, sexist, homophobic, sexually explicit, or suggestive, abusive or otherwise discriminatory content.&#x20;
* Posts on DAO should serve and work towards the mission and/or goals of the DAO. Therefore, posts unrelated to the DAOs objectives (such as for advertising, self-promote or other purposes) should be avoided and will be deleted. We strongly believe in our DAOâ€™s teamwork and collaboration.&#x20;
* Administrators reserve the right to ban from the DAO whoever does not comply with the above guidelines,even without prior notice
