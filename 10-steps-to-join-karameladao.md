## <mark style="color:purple;">2.Go to #intro channel in Discord</mark>&#x20;

You have already made great advance… It’s about time for the “to know us better” step. On your left hand side, there is an #intro channel. You are more than welcome to visit and introduce yourself by sharing whatever you feel Karamelians should know about you - …yep, we mean anything you would like to share with us.

## <mark style="color:purple;">3. Snoop around #chit-chat channel in Discord</mark>&#x20;

We know… it’s quite likely you have that feeling “I want to know more about what’s happening here”. Here’s the place where you can get a glimpse of the discussions going on — (Along the way, you may feel overwhelmed, but don’t worry, it happened to all of us. Too much info to be handled).

***

## <mark style="color:purple;">4.Create your MetaMask wallet</mark>&#x20;

Obviously, if you haven’t one already… (In that case, skip this step, you lucky! You’re already one step closer). However, if you don’t have one, we got your back - in case you need some help.

Below, we have prepared a comprehensive guide for you!&#x20;



Setting up MetaMask

***

Whether you’re looking to create your first non-fungible token (NFT), lend assets on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or simply buy and transfer Ethereum-based tokens, you’ll first need to download compatible crypto-wallet software.&#x20;

This will allow you to store any assets you create or buy, as well as connect to any platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

While there are a number of different wallet services available, MetaMask is by far the most popular with over 21 million monthly active users – up by 38x since 2020.&#x20;

To put it simply, MetaMask is a free hot wallet service available as a smartphone app or web browser extension. This means you can download it directly onto your phone or Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave or Edge browsers, similar to an ad blocker extension. The “hot” part simply means it is permanently connected to the internet so that you can easily move your crypto assets around at any time.

One of the key reasons MetaMask is so popular among new and existing crypto users is its interoperability with virtually all Ethereum-based platforms. MetaMask allows users to connect to more than 3,700 different decentralized applications and Web 3 services.

This is one of the main reasons we use Metamask instead of a Coinbase wallet. Since metamask is an open e-wallet it allows users to connect to any network and import any kind of token that is Ethereum based.

So, the question is: How do you set up your own MetaMask crypto wallet?

***

### -MetaMask Installation

The first thing you’ll need to do is download the MetaMask wallet software onto your chosen device by visiting the official website here: https://metamask.io/download/ You will be presented with the following options:

● Browser: Compatible with Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Edge website browser.

● Android: Compatible with any smartphone that operates using Android’s operating system.

● iOS: Compatible with any iPhone. Once you have selected the appropriate option, click the “Install MetaMask for…” button. Navigate to the extension icon in the top right corner of your web browser and find the MetaMask option, once you’ve successfully downloaded the software. Click the “Get Started” button and you’ll be taken to the next page and presented with two options (see below):

***

### - MetaMask wallet import / creation

● Import wallet: For users who already have an existing MetaMask wallet on a different device and would like to import it over to a new one. Select “Import wallet” and follow the prompts.

● Create a wallet: For users who want to set up a brand new MetaMask wallet. Select the “Create a Wallet” option, agree to a short disclaimer that appears and create a password when prompted.As with any password, it’s vitally important you physically write several copies of the password down on different pieces of paper. You should never create a digital copy of any password you create; this includes actions like taking a screenshot of it, sending it to yourself in an email or saving it as a note on your computer. Anything digital that’s stored on your computer is accessible to hackers – don’t make life easy for them. You will need to enter your password each time you wish to access your MetaMask wallet.

***

### -Secret Recovery Phrase

A screen will then appear that outlines what a secret recovery phrase is, how you should copy it down (again, on paper not in digital form) and information on why you should never share your secret recovery phrase with anyone.

In short, your secret recovery phrase comprises 12 random words. It’s there as a backup in case you lose the phone or laptop where your MetaMask wallet is downloaded and need to import it to a new device.

You will need to carefully copy down each word in the order they are presented on the screen. The order of the words is crucial as you won’t be able to import your account to a new device if the words are in the wrong order – even if you entered all the right 12 words.

MetaMask will then prompt you to type in the 12-word sequence before you can move on to the final steps.

AGAIN: DON’T SHARE THE SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE

_**Congrats! You are one step closer to the sweetness!**_

c) A chance to meet and exchange thoughts with other newcomers and feel part of the community

d) To better evaluate how you can fit in, contribute and enrich our mission and culture

e) The best for the end… to be awarded with your very first $loll - your ticket to unlock additional channels and become a Karamela Baker (where a new world reveals itself, just in front of your eyes!)

Extra tip: You can also participate in our weekly community call and share your views, connect, listen, share and contribute — we’d love to hear you. In any way, it’s an alternative way to take your first $loll!

How to be informed and join the next upcoming call:

On the left hand side of your discord environment, very close to the top, you can locate the “events” button. Click on it and a pop up window will arise. Locate the onboarding event and just click “Interested”.

Voila! That’s all!

You will receive a push notification when the next onboarding call is taking place.

In case you are soooooooo sweet and want to be sure that you will jump in the call, try the three dots next to “Share” button and select “Add to Calendar”.

***

## <mark style="color:purple;">6.Send your MetaMask wallet public address to the Onboarding Call Facilitator</mark>

Sometimes a huge “THANK YOU” isn’t enough to express your appreciation to someone...

&#x20;We profoundly believe this and with that gesture, you give us the opportunity to prove it!

By sending your wallet public address (make sure it’s the public address) you will be able to receive your first $loll, which is your ticket to become a more active member, as more channels will be revealed in Discord.

## <mark style="color:purple;">7.Add Polygon Network (+Lollipop tokens) to your MetaMask wallet</mark>

You are just one step away…

Follow this simple guide on how to import your $loll in your MetaMask wallet:

### **Adding Polygon Network:**

***

How to setup MetaMask to connect to Matic Network

* Switch the connected blockchain by clicking on the tab saying “Main Ethereum Network” - we need to add the Matic network.
* Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.
* Enter in the Polygon/Matic Mainnet settings as follows:

● Network Name: Polygon

● New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com or https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network or https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com or https://rpc-mainnet.matic.quiknode.pro

(Using https://polygon-rpc.com is most recommended as it aggregates multiple RPC URLs! See below for more information.)

● ChainID: 137

● Symbol: MATIC

● Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com/

***

* Click Save.

You have now connected to the Polygon/Matic mainnet with your Metamask Wallet!

***

Important note: Transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. This means that if you want to transfer Lollipop to your best friend you will **need to have some MATIC in your wallet** which will be used as gas fee!

***

**So, why Polygon and not Ethereum directly?**

The answer is simple - Gas Fees! As Ethereum has grown in popularity its gas fees have exploded reaching $100-$300 for simple transactions! This has made chains like Polygon, which is a Layer2 Network on Ethereum, a reason to flourish, as they are much cheaper and faster to transact. For comparison a simple transaction in Polygon will cost less than $0.01! This is insane!

### Adding Lollipop Token:

***

How to add a Lollipop \[custom token]

* Click on “Import tokens”, located at the bottom of the “Assets” tab on your wallet homepage.

***

* Switch to the “Custom token” tab at the top, and then enter the token address in the first field. (See below if you don't know where to find this).

***

* In most cases, the token symbol and token decimal will autofill.

(If you still can't find the token details, try locating the token's documentation through a web search).

***

* Click 'Add Custom Token' to proceed.

You will now see a page asking you to confirm that you want to add the token.

When you click 'Import Tokens', the token type will be added to your wallet.

***

## <mark style="color:purple;">8.Go to #collabland-join in Discord</mark>

…and hit “Let’s go!” — the Collab.Land bot will validate you as a Citizen with temporary citizenship, granting you access to Baker’s channels and material. (If you are brave enough, take a selfie and see your face afterwards! The content revealed is FABULOUS!)

Quick tip on the Collab.Land bot: To leverage the Collab.Land bot, you will be asked to connect your wallet to the bot so it may verify you are the wallet owner.

For best results, make sure you are on your Discord desktop app to complete these steps and you have already downloaded and setup your Crypto wallet.

How it works:

***

1. Locate the #COLLABLAND-JOIN channel.
2. Click the "Let’s go!" button and you will get a private reply message in the channel to start the process.
3. Click on “Connect Wallet” to start the wallet connection/verification flow.
4. Choose “MetaMask” on the next prompt.
5. Click “Sign Message” button in the next screen
6. Next, you will get a prompt to sign in to your wallet:
7. …and voila! Normally, you should get a message that your wallet connected
8. Go back to discord and verify that you were granted a role

## <mark style="color:purple;">9. Fill in our onboarding survey</mark>
