## Discord

Discord is currently the place where most of our action is happening. We have organized our members' core structure through teams and projects, and we communicate on a 24hr basis. DAOs never sleep! So how does the Karamela discord works?

You can join the Karamela Discord server through a public or personal invite.

In our Server you can find :

i. **Events**

ii **Public Channels**

iii.**Private channels** (visible to Citizens Only)

### i. Events

On the upper left corner, you can find our Events lists. Events are hosted in our voice channels on discord, or on our twitter page

Events that you will see there are :

Community Calls : This is our weekly gathering, to discuss and inform about KaramelaDAOâ€™s progress. We host it every Wednesday at 19:00 ( 7 p.m.) CET, every week (happens@ discord # Public Voice channel) Please note that occasionally the time/date can change, due to holidays or other reasons, so keep posted on our #announcements channel

Onboarding calls : This is our welcome event to new members. We meet, solve questions and help people onboard on KaramelaDAO. It is hosted in different dates and times (and languages) , in a weekly basis, so it can fit a wide audience (happens@ discord # Public Voice channel)

Twitter Spaces : This is our relaxed chat, news discussing , futuristic talk and community bonding meeting. We host it every Friday 20:00 (8 p.m.) CET, almost every week! (happens@ KaramelaDAOâ€™s twitter channel)

Teams / Project Calls : These calls are team or project meetings, so progress can be achieved faster. Usually are planned within the team, and you have to be a Citizen to participate as a listener (happens@ #Bakery Voice Channel)

### iii.Private channels

In order someone to see the content here , has to be a Citizen (or a Temporary Citizen) and has already connected its wallet through collab.land

Private channels are divided in 3 main categories. We won't dive deeper for the present document, just explain their core functions .

\#Discussion Channels Channels for specific topics. Proposals, Jobs, Citizen discussion, Governance, Citizen Nomination and others are here

\#Team Channels Channels to form teams and communicate efficiently. Teams Strategy, Media, Finance and others, function here

\#Project Channels Channels to work on projects. When a proposal for a project passes, we create a channel to build the core team, and inform other citizens about its progress. Come and see what is cooking!&#x20;

### iv. Bots

We use several Bots to keep our Server organized and functionable Here is a list of what we use at the moment, and why:

**Collab.Land** Bot This is a bot that allows our Discord Server, to see our wallets, so other bots and functions can perform correctly. You can connect your wallet through our #Collabland-join channel

**ServerStats** This bot counts how many followers and citizens we have at the moment in our Discord Server. You can check the results in SERVER STATS , right below the #collabland-join Channel

**Sobol** This bot integrates with our Sobol tool
