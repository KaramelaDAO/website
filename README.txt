THE TAILWIND JIT MODE IS USED IN THIS PROJECT.
So if you want to add some more tailwind classes and want to do any more changes, run this command in terminal before doing any changes.

  "npm run watch:css"

ALSO NOTE PLEASE:

DON'T TOUCH THE "output.css" FILE IN THE STYLES FOLDER.
This file is handling by tailwind css.
So if you want to add some custom css, do it in the "tailwind.css" file in the styles folder.
