### **What is a DAO?** <a href="#_276a7msbiqhv" id="_276a7msbiqhv"></a>

A DAO is a member-owned community without centralized leadership, whose members have entered into a contract with one another to reach a coordinated goal.

## Onboarding <a href="#_5lp0ulfan5ep" id="_5lp0ulfan5ep"></a>

### **How can I become a Baker?** <a href="#_stwxvvudx46b" id="_stwxvvudx46b"></a>

The first step is to be in our discord, read, learn and have questions.

The second step is to come in on an Onboarding Call and solve those questions,\
claim 1 $loll for participation, and reveil the channels we work together

### **What do I do after I receive my first $loll** <a href="#_z388gzwv900j" id="_z388gzwv900j"></a>

First make sure you don’t use a COINBASE/KRAKEN/EXCHANGE address! The coins will be lost! Use Metamask!\
You can then go to our collabland channel, in discord and hit “Let’s Go” button.\
Follow the directions and connect your wallet. This will redirect you to Collab.land page.\
After that you should be granted your Baker role, and the Citizen-Only Channels will be revealed

### **How can I become a Citizen?** <a href="#_si3w2ef566yd" id="_si3w2ef566yd"></a>

Buying one of our only 300 NFT Citizenships will give you the Citizen role.

### **How do I buy my Citizen NFT? Where do I see it?**

You can still mint one [at OMGdrops.com Marketplace.](https://omgdrops.com/karameladao/karameladao-nft-citizenship-first-builders\_XnrLpELhoy/)

Our granted Citizenships can also be found and resold after mint, in all major marketplaces like [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/omgdrops-v2?search%5Bquery%5D=karamela\&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true\&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE), [Rarible ](https://rarible.com/collection/0xf649802fb1c3b4ccea7468c3473915b09741b0e6/items)etc

_We occasionally reward active Bakers with a free NFT Citizenship. This is done by voting._

### **What are the differences between a Baker and a Citizen?** <a href="#_1bkmjt3p88q3" id="_1bkmjt3p88q3"></a>

In bullets can be compared above, in both “benefits” questions.\
In general Citizens play the role of Stockholders and Bakers the role of Workers , but things can get really blurry and creative in a DAO! Most of us are both :-)

### **How does KaramelaDAO takes decisions?** <a href="#_o8uo1q1z08cw" id="_o8uo1q1z08cw"></a>

To do that, a Citizen (or a group of them) should apply with a formal proposal.

## Tokenomics <a href="#_kyfj1d87x5hi" id="_kyfj1d87x5hi"></a>

### **What is $loll (lollipop token)?** <a href="#_6g5ca5sl0jhn" id="_6g5ca5sl0jhn"></a>

Our token ($loll) is a simple ERC20 contract on the Polygon Network.

You can go to PolyScan to monitor the Lollipop activity and get more information about our token. Also, don’t forget to go to our github if you want to dig deeper into the secrets of the sweetest token in the metaverse.

### **How do I see $loll on Metamask** <a href="#_9eb5j2welvvv" id="_9eb5j2welvvv"></a>

#### **What is the general Tokenomics structure?** <a href="#_ta7x90xdhx0" id="_ta7x90xdhx0"></a>

Karamelonomics are simple :\
50% of profits will go to Karamelians, through our token ($loll).\
Anyone can exchange $loll to ETH directly from our treasury!\
Thus the **minimum** $loll value will always be $loll =

50% treasury /1million (total $loll in circulation)

30% will remain in the treasury\
10% marketing\
10% charity

#### **Have those tokenomics been tried before, in other projects/DAOs ?** <a href="#_vsab5qrr1oe0" id="_vsab5qrr1oe0"></a>

No. Karamelonomics are genuine, and we believe it would be an amazing way of blending workers with stockholders, in a creative web3 way

#### **Can I convert my $loll?** <a href="#_z93rko1i4apk" id="_z93rko1i4apk"></a>

Yes. We have our DEX (Decentralized exchange) almost ready and will share the details soon.
