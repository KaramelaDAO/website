#### **What is Notion?** <a href="#_ihqg2ars96e3" id="_ihqg2ars96e3"></a>

Notion is a collaboration platform with modified markdown support that integrates kanban boards, tasks, wikis, and databases. The software is an all-in-one workspace for note-taking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management. It is a file management tool offering a unified workspace, allowing users to comment on ongoing projects, participate in discussions, and receive feedback. In addition to cross-platform apps, it can be accessed via most web browsers.

The software includes a tool for "clipping" content from webpages. Notion helps users schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, set reminders, keep agendas, and organize their work. Notion allows writing & pasting equations in the form of blocks or inline, as it supports LaTeX. Users can also embed online content in their Notion pages using Embed.ly, in this way notes can also be efficiently typed down alongside an embedded video playing in PiP mode.
