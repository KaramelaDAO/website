# Setting Up Metamask

### Setting Up Metamask

Whether you’re looking to create your first non-fungible token ([NFT](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-create-buy-and-sell-nfts/)), [lend](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/07/13/defi-lending-3-major-risks-to-know/) [assets](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/07/13/defi-lending-3-major-risks-to-know/) on a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/)) protocol or simply buy and transfer [Ethereum-based tokens](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/09/what-is-the-erc-20-ethereum-token-standard/), you’ll first need to download compatible [crypto-wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/your-first-crypto-wallet-how-to-use-it-and-why-you-need-one/) software. This will allow you to store any assets you create or buy, as well as connect to any platform built on top of the [Ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-blockchain-technology/).

While there are a number of different wallet services available, MetaMask is by far the most popular with over [21 million monthly active users](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211117006028/en/MetaMask-Surpasses-21-Million-MAUs-as-ConsenSys-Raises-200-Million-to-Make-Web3-Universally-Easy-to-Use-Access-and-Build-On) – up by 38x since 2020. To put it simply, MetaMask is a free hot wallet service available as a smartphone app or web browser extension. This means you can download it directly onto your phone or the Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave or Edge browser similar to an ad blocker extension. The “hot” part simply means it’s permanently connected to the internet so that you can easily move your crypto assets around at any time.

One of the key reasons MetaMask is so popular among new and existing crypto users is its interoperability with virtually all Ethereum-based platforms. MetaMask allows users to connect to more than 3,700 different [decentralized](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-application/) [applications](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-application/) and [Web 3 services](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-web-3-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/).

This is one of the main reasons we use Metamask instead of a Coinbase wallet. Since metamask is an open e-wallet it allows users to connect to any network and import any kind of token that is Ethereum based.

So the question is, how do you set up your own MetaMask crypto wallet?

**Installation**

The first thing you’ll need to do is download the MetaMask wallet software onto your chosen device by visiting the official website [here](https://metamask.io). You will be presented with the following options:

* **Browser:** Compatible with Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Edge website browser.
* **Android:** Compatible with any smartphone that operates using Android’s operating system.
* **iOS:** Compatible with any iPhone.

Once you’ve selected the appropriate option, click the “Install MetaMask for

…” button.

Navigate to the extension icon in the top right corner of your web browser and find the MetaMask option, once you’ve successfully downloaded the software. Click the “Get Started” button and you’ll be taken to the next page and presented with two options (see below.)

* **Import wallet:** This is for users who already have an existing MetaMask wallet on a different device and would like to import it over to a new one.
* **Create a wallet:** This is for users who want to set up a brand new MetaMask wallet.

Select the “Create a Wallet” option, agree to a short disclaimer that appears and create a password when prompted. As with any password, it’s vitally important you physically write several copies of the password down on different pieces of paper. You should [never create a digital copy](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/04/20/4-ways-to-stay-safe-in-crypto/) of any password you create; this includes actions like taking a screenshot of it, sending it to yourself in an email or saving it as a note on your computer.

Anything digital that’s stored on your computer is accessible to hackers – don’t make life easy for them.

You will need to enter your password each time you wish to access your MetaMask wallet.

**Secret recovery phrase**

A screen will then appear that outlines what a secret recovery phrase is, how you should copy it down (again, on paper not in digital form) and information on why you should never share your secret recovery phrase with anyone.

In short, your secret recovery phrase comprises 12 random words. It’s there as a backup in case you lose the phone or laptop where your MetaMask wallet is downloaded and need to import it to a new device.

You will need to carefully copy down each word in the order they are presented on the screen. The order of the words is crucial as you won’t be able to import your account to a new device if the words are in the wrong order – even if you entered all the right 12 words.

MetaMask will then prompt you to type in the 12-word sequence before you can move on to the final steps.

AGAIN - DON’T SHARE THE SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE!
