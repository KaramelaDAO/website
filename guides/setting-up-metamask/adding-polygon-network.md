Enter in the Polygon/Matic Mainnet settings as follows:

*
  * **Network Name:** Polygon
  * **New RPC URL:** [**https://polygon-rpc.com** ](https://polygon-rpc.com)or

[https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network](https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network) or [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com) or [https://rpc-mainnet.matic.quiknode.pro](https://rpc-mainnet.matic.quiknode.pro)

_(Using https://polygon-rpc.com is most recommended as it aggregates multiple RPC URLs! See below for more information.)_

*
  * **ChainID:** 137
  * **Symbol:** MATIC

Metamask for Polygon

Click **Save**.

You have now connected to the Polygon / Matic mainnet with your Metamask Wallet!

### Transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee.

**This means that if you want to transfer Lollipop to your best friend you will need to have some MATIC in your wallet which will be used as gas fee!**

So why Polygon and not Ethereum directly?

The answer is simple - Gas Fees! As Ethereum has grown in popularity itâ€™s gas fees have exploded reaching $100-$300 for simple transactions!

This has made chains like Polygon, which is a Layer2 Network on Ethereum, a reason to flourish, as they are much cheaper and faster to transact. For comparison a simple transaction in Polygon will cost less than $0.01! This is insane!
